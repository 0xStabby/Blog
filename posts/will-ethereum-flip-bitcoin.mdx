Will Ethereum flip Bitcoin?

![first post image](/images/Will-Ethereum-flip-Bitcoin.png)

If we recall back to 2014-2015, the beginning of the year, we would have considered Bitcoin as an asset that has lost its dominance and was at the bottom of the cryptocurrency market cap. However, BTC recovered almost all its lost ground and gained back its position in the top ten cryptocurrencies. Most of the market players considered BTC as the world’s #1 cryptocurrency back then, and the market predictions of its price going up were pretty accurate.

Back in those days, the consensus among the market players was that Bitcoin will surpass Ethereum and become the world’s #1 cryptocurrency; however, as we know, Ethereum’s price went up and reached its all-time high in January 2018, while Bitcoin remained under $4,000 at the time. Since then, the market has been volatile, and many people are now asking what might have happened to the Bitcoin price, and if it is on its death bed.



If we can come back to the beginning of 2017, we would have considered Bitcoin as the world’s #1 cryptocurrency again. However, the question people were asking was whether Ethereum can surpass Bitcoin. What happened to Ethereum? Why didn’t it become the world’s #1 cryptocurrency? We will try to answer these questions and find out what has happened to Ethereum and Bitcoin, and if it is possible for Ethereum to become the world’s #1 cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Understanding the difference

The first thing we need to understand is to distinguish between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin and Ethereum are two different blockchains and coins that use different principles to back their cryptocurrencies.

The main difference between them is the way that they are created. Bitcoin is created using proof-of-work mechanism, while Ethereum is created using proof-of-stake.

It is also important to note that Bitcoin is an open-source system, while Ethereum is a closed-source system. Therefore, Ethereum is not regulated by any central authorities, while Bitcoin is regulated from the top by a team of programmers.

While Bitcoin is not regulated by any central authorities, Ethereum is regulated by a team of developers.

Bitcoin is created by and for the users, while Ethereum’s creation was led by a team of developers with the intention to allow users to create their own programmable blockchain.

Another important difference between them is that Bitcoin is an open-source system, while Ethereum is not.

A fully functioning Bitcoin system has three main components:

Blockchain – the public ledger of transactions,

Nodes – the nodes that are used to validate transactions and make it available to the public, and

Miners – the people who process transactions and create blocks.

All these three components have been set up in a way that one cannot replace other components, so while one can change the miners, the nodes, or the blockchain, it will not produce any changes.

It is also important to note that the consensus of the network is based on the proof of work, which has to be reached by all miners, while in the case of Ethereum, it has been decided that the consensus will be decided by a majority of votes.

All these three components have been set up in a way that one cannot replace other components.

So, what makes Ethereum different?

The first thing is that while Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum has no such restriction. Ethereum will continue to increase its supply to 21 million coins after every block mined.

The second and the most significant difference is that Bitcoin is set up to allow users to mine the blocks using their personal computers, while there is no such option for Ethereum.

In Ethereum, instead of mining blocks, the people that are called miners are called “block producers”. They have been given the power to create blocks using their own computers and to charge their own fee for creating blocks.

A block is a piece of data that contains information about all Bitcoin transactions that occurred on that given block, and every Bitcoin block contains a timestamp.

Ethereum can also be divided into blocks, and each block has a timestamp. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a public ledger of transactions, and the ledger is also publicly available, unlike Bitcoin, where it can only be used by the miners.

The third and the biggest difference is that it allows users to create their own programmable software using one or more “smart contracts”.

Smart contracts are programs that can interact
