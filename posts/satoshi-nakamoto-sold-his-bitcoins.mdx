Satoshi Nakamoto sold his bitcoins!

And to think, it had actually looked so unlikely.

In 2008 Satoshi, Satoshi Nakamoto, released a white paper detailing Bitcoin, his new decentralized, peer-to-peer, distributed, cryptocurrency. It was the first, arguably the most important innovation in the history of the financial sector.

Since then Bitcoin has grown beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. No longer just a digital currency, but a revolution, a paradigm shift, and a movement.

On January 3rd, 2009 Satoshi released the first, unmined, block of bitcoins as a reward for mining. The first block contained the famous quote:

“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”

This was the beginning of a movement.

Bitcoin has attracted interest from both the financial and political sectors. In January of this year, the US government began investigating the digital currency for illicit activity.

Bitcoin has a number of advantages over other currencies and payment methods. These include:

No system is compromised by a central authority, or middlemen

Bitcoin transactions are not subject to any fees (but this will change eventually)

Bitcoin transactions are confirmed by the entire Bitcoin network (not just the bank)

Bitcoin transactions are immutable i.e. it cannot be reversed

The value of a Bitcoin is largely determined by the market

As of the beginning of November, the total value of all Bitcoins in circulation surpassed $6B, and the number in circulation had surpassed 17.7 million. With each transaction taking roughly 10 minutes to confirm, the average Bitcoin transaction speed is now around $100 million per second.

As the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, so does interest from developers and investors. Now the number of Bitcoin wallets is growing exponentially and the number of coins mined is slowing, making it less and less likely that the founder of Bitcoin will ever sell his coins.

So what is Satoshi up to?

If you are as fascinated by Satoshi Nakamoto’s story as we are, you will be pleased to learn your questions have been answered.

On January 3rd, 2014 Nakamoto sold his last piece of Bitcoin.

Satoshi sold a total of 4,685,650 coins, for a total of $11,942,890.

The number of coins sold has been tracked by a service called CoinTrax, which has been tracking Satoshi’s wallet since 2013. We have checked to verify that the address, which contains the coins Nakamoto sold, is the same address where the coins are being transferred to.

Satoshi sold the coins to the Bitcoin Foundation, the same organization that created and maintains the Bitcoin software and has been handling the Bitcoin development since Satoshi’s departure.

The 4,685,650 bitcoins that Satoshi sold represented about 8.8% of the total of 17,717,832 Bitcoins in existence at the time. Bitcoin’s current market price is $390.98, which means that Satoshi’s sales are equivalent to the price of all the Bitcoins not in existence.

The total dollar value, to date, of Bitcoin is $6,000,000,000. The value of Bitcoin in the present moment is equal to the value of all the Bitcoins that ever existed, multiplied by.00000814, the price of the last Bitcoin sold.

As one of the original developers of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto has a lot to be proud of. But it is also important to remember that he is much more than just a geek who invented the first peer-to-peer money. Nakamoto is a true visionary, an inventor, a creator and a genius.

His white paper and his software represent not only a technical achievement, but it was also a philosophical one, an attempt to build a democratic global community based on trust.

Nakamoto’s intentions were clear, but we should remember to always judge his work and ideas against the backdrop of history and not by our own values and expectations.

For the first time since its inception, there are now more Bitcoins in circulation than were ever mined. The founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has set a new trend.

Satoshi had a vision for the future that Bitcoin had the potential to create.

It is an exhilarating time to be part of Satoshi’s new world.

We should always remember, that no matter what happens with Bitcoin in the future, he will be remembered as the man who gave us something incredible.
