Is coinbase solvent?

![first post image](/images/Is-coinbase-solvent.png)

Yes, coinbase is solvent, at least according to their most recent earnings reports.
According to the latest quarterly report available[0] for coinbase, they had total revenues of $11,832,000 in Q4 2018, with $8,639,000 in Q1, $12,941,000 in Q2, $27,619,000 in Q3, and $20,843,000 in Q4 of 2019.
That's not a huge amount compared to the $30 million in revenues from the top 50 exchanges, but it's still $2 million in Q4.
Furthermore, it's a publicly traded company, so you'd have to be a complete idiot to bet against it, as its market cap ($1.8 billion) is greater than that of the top 50 exchanges combined.
