Look out for these coins in the next bull run:

This article is going to be a little more general than the other two, but if you read those you can get a pretty solid idea of where we’re headed.

So what’s the best investment?

Well, it depends on your goals. So let’s break it down.

Gold

Gold is obviously king. There’s no question about that. However, there are a few reasons why it’s not the best investment for everybody.

It’s expensive as hell. If you have it now, it’s a nice souvenir, but you’ll find it’s too costly to buy back in, especially when the inflationary pressures of the economy start kicking in. You’re better off using it as collateral on a loan or putting it in the mattress.

You’re actually losing value, not gaining value if you put it in the bank. That’s because banks keep a fixed value on the supply of money. So you’re losing value as inflation erodes their purchasing power. And you can’t convert it to anything else, so it’s stuck there.

It’s a big physical object that can’t be easily used for trade with the rest of the economy. If there’s a run on that physical gold, you’re SOL. Imagine the chaos and loss of wealth if there was a run on US Dollars, and we’d all suddenly have to exchange them for Euros.

It’s a pain to store. It’s heavy. It’s inconvenient. It’s subject to being taken from you. It’s not that portable. It’s an awful way to store value.

Gold isn’t a great investment if you want to make a lot of short-term moves in and out. Short-term investors should keep their money in the bank – or maybe a combination of bank and bonds. It’s one of the best places to invest your money right now.

Silver

Silver is the second best. It has the same problems as gold, but it’s cheaper to store because it’s easier to transport. It also has a very similar market valuation to gold, which means it can be converted to gold easier than gold can be converted to dollars. And if you buy silver, you own the rights to the entire amount of the physical metal that ever comes on the market.

It’s the perfect investment for people who don’t want to be locked into one commodity.

You can use silver for trade in the other direction as well. If the economy is depressed, you can buy a ton of cheap silver and use it to make other products, perhaps more useful ones such as electronics. You can also put silver into the bank and get it out whenever you want, like gold. It just makes more sense in terms of how to store your money.

I recommend silver because it’s a very good way for an individual to invest for the long term, and it’s a pretty decent way to trade for a short-term.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a lot like gold. It’s expensive, it’s heavy, and it’s inconvenient. You can’t sell it like a physical commodity, because it’s digital. You can only buy it one BTC at a time from another person. That makes it very hard to trade.

Bitcoin is also the only one of the three investments that can’t be used for trade in the other direction – at least not without using a third party to trade. So if you want to make a lot of short-term moves in and out of your coins, it’s a bad idea. If you’re looking for a better medium of exchange, you’re much better off buying it directly from the people you’re trading with.
