Why bitcoin does not need regulation but centralized exchanges do

![first post image](/images/first-post-content.png)

It’s only been a few months that bitcoin has been in the news. With a market capitalization of $6 billion and growing, bitcoin has become a household name and has been labeled a fad. This narrative of bitcoin has been fueled by the media’s constant barrage of negative news stories on the subject. What if I told you that there was a way to take the decentralized, censorship-resistant cryptocurrency and make it centralized-resistant?

I want to make it very clear that I do not believe there is a need for regulation in the cryptocurrency space. The industry is relatively young and has room for growth, and as long as people are educated on the technology, it has the potential to succeed.

However, a decentralized cryptocurrency such as bitcoin requires a few core pieces of infrastructure in order to be successful.

The first of these is an exchange that allows people to exchange bitcoin for fiat currency. This is typically facilitated through a centralized or decentralized exchange.

As I described in a previous article, the centralized exchanges that are emerging today are centralized in the same way that traditional exchanges are centralized. They are run by a company that allows you to deposit money, buy cryptocurrency, and trade it.

I personally do not think that these centralized exchanges are necessary to the success of bitcoin. They would not prevent people from buying bitcoin themselves and trading directly with each other.

Instead, what centralized exchanges can do is give users access to a larger amount of bitcoin than they would be able to get through a decentralized exchange. This is because they have more capital and liquidity to invest.

It also gives them an advantage over decentralized exchanges that do not have access to a large pool of capital or liquidity. For example, decentralized exchanges often rely on people to send them and hold them in escrow for them. It would be expensive for decentralized exchanges to pay for large amounts of transaction fees and be able to hold those funds in escrow.

The second component is wallets. Wallets are the “paperwork” of the cryptocurrency, the place where you store the cryptocurrency that you have purchased on an exchange. They are also the place that you interact with the network.

This is why bitcoin wallets do not need to be decentralized at all. Wallets do not have to be on your computer or phone. Wallets can be any place that accepts digital currency, even a bank or a post office.

However, centralized exchanges offer an abstraction layer that allows people to trade a digital currency directly for currency on their own computer or phone. Even if you have your own wallet, you can use the exchange to interact with the network.

The third piece is infrastructure. This includes things like block explorers, block chain websites, and cryptocurrency ATM machines. You can think of infrastructure as the plumbing of the cryptocurrency network. Like the wallets, the decentralized nature of bitcoin does not have to be true for it to work.

The reality is that bitcoin’s infrastructure is centralized in a way that is very similar to how the telecommunications industry is today. The decentralized nature of the internet does not mean that we cannot use the internet in a centralized way.

In fact, that is exactly how the internet came about. The government of the United States decided that it made sense to create the infrastructure that would make the internet possible. Today, the United States is a leader in both the adoption of the internet and the development of the infrastructure.

What I’m essentially saying is that bitcoin does not need to be decentralized because a centralized infrastructure is already there that can support it.

The question that the cryptocurrency industry needs to answer is: Should the infrastructure of bitcoin be decentralized or centralized?

I’m not saying that the answer to that question is yes, but I don’t think the cryptocurrency industry should be afraid to use centralized infrastructure since that’s exactly what we have today.

When it comes to the blockchain, it is important to keep in mind that the blockchain is a public ledger that records every single transaction, and all of them are recorded publicly.

This is important to note because if we are going to use it to disrupt the financial system, we will need to have a trusted third party that records all of our transactions.

In order for the industry to disrupt the traditional financial system, they should trust the technology and the people who are utilizing the technology. If that’s the case, I see no reason why we can’t trust centralized institutions to use the technology.

It is also important to note that while we are disrupting the financial system today, the technology is still very new. We need to be careful not to burn the baby with the bath water.
