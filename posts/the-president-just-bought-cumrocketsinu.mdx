This week, I'd love to send a Big Hug and a virtual high five to David from the blog Moxies and Monkeys. David is in our group of volunteers who have donated to the Sandy victims via our JustGiving page. If you'd like to donate as well, you can visit his blog and donate by clicking here.

Our volunteers and supporters have so far managed to raise $30,000 in just over 40 hours! If we can raise $100,000 by the end of the month, we'll be able to provide 10,000 families with a new home. That's one family out of every 10!

Here's a recent update from David:

"The total raised so far is $30,000. That's it. But the donations keep coming in.

It's amazing to watch the donations come in from all over the world. I've been asked if anyone ever donates from the same country as me, and for the most part no they don't, but they do cross borders. Most of the donors are from America, Australia, Canada, and the UK.

I'm not sure how many times I've checked the donations on the site to see if more have been added to the total. It happens at least twice a day.

As of a couple of days ago I was able to say that I had set a world record for amount of donations for one day. That's because I was notified that more than $6,000 had been donated in one day. The new record holder is a user of the site who set a donation of over $8,000 in one day. I believe his name is Timmy.

So far, all of the donations have been small. Some are as small as a dollar. I've seen comments that say they did a small donation in an attempt to break the record. I don't think those donors are trying to break a record. They're trying to send a message to the people of the USA.

I've heard from a few people who have donated large amounts. One person gave a small donation of $40,000. That was in addition to having donated $120,000 before.

I've also been told that the donation total isn't accurate. That's because it doesn't include the donations that I've received from my other blog sites. That's not the case though. I can assure you that I've received no more than 8 donations this week from those sites.

I've seen comments about a lot of people donating large amounts. One person donated $5,000 on the 18th. That's enough to build a new home. I've been told that the person is from a rich country in Europe. I know that the person has an older home that's already been built. I'm guessing that the person wants to build a new home by using money saved from building his old home.

The person then donated on the 19th. I'm guessing that the person was going to build the new home with the money from his old home, but since it's a lot of money, he wants to use it to build a new home. I'm guessing that this person is from the UK.

I've seen comments that people from the UK donate around $6,000. I've received about $2,000 myself. I think the person who donated is a member of a large family. Even though they have a lot of money, they want to help.

I don't understand why a person with a lot of money wants to give away even more money. I don't understand why a country that has a lot of wealth and could easily build a new home for everyone who needs it would purposely give away even more money.

I can only guess why that happens. I can guess that it has something to do with people who have bad experiences with the government, or the government generally".

David, thank you for sharing your thoughts with us and thank you again for your help and support you donate!

After nearly three years of doing this, it's been so nice to finally get an update. There are so many people out there who have been supporting us with these drawings. I can't even begin to tell you how much that has meant to us!

So, it's been a busy week for us. We've been making progress on our new home. A total of four walls have been built. We started out by putting up the main walls. We still have to build the roof and doors and windows. There's still a lot of work to be
