## How to write secure solidity contracts, tips and tricks

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. As such, it is essential that smart contracts are secure and error-free to prevent malicious attacks and ensure the smooth functioning of the blockchain network.

Solidity is the most commonly used programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In this blog post, we will outline some best practices for writing secure Solidity smart contract code.

### Keep it Simple
* The first and most important rule of writing secure Solidity smart contracts is to keep it simple. This means writing code that is easy to read and understand. Complex code can lead to bugs and make it difficult to spot vulnerabilities.

### Follow the Principle of Least Privilege
* The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a security concept that states that users should be given the minimum amount of access they need to perform their tasks. In Solidity smart contracts, this means restricting access to certain functions and variables. By limiting access, you reduce the potential for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in your code.

### Use SafeMath Library
* One of the most common vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts is integer overflow and underflow. The SafeMath library is a tool that helps prevent these vulnerabilities by providing a safe way to perform arithmetic operations on unsigned integers. Always use the SafeMath library when working with integers in your smart contract.

### Beware of Re-Entrancy Attacks
* A re-entrancy attack is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to repeatedly execute a function before the previous execution has completed. This can result in unintended consequences such as theft of funds. To prevent re-entrancy attacks, always use the modifier "nonReentrant" to ensure that a function cannot be called again until the previous execution has completed.

### Use Time-Stamp for Security Checks
* When writing Solidity smart contracts, you may need to implement time-based security checks such as limiting the frequency of certain functions. To do this, use the "block.timestamp" function to get the current timestamp of the blockchain. Be aware that this function can be manipulated by miners, so use it judiciously.

### Test Your Code Thoroughly
* Thoroughly testing your Solidity smart contract code is crucial to ensure its security and reliability. Use tools such as Truffle and Ganache to simulate the blockchain environment and test your code under different conditions. Make sure to test for edge cases and ensure that your code works as intended.

In conclusion, writing secure Solidity smart contract code requires following best practices and being diligent in your testing. By keeping your code simple, following the Principle of Least Privilege, using the SafeMath library, preventing re-entrancy attacks, using time-stamp for security checks, and testing your code thoroughly, you can minimize vulnerabilities and ensure the smooth functioning of your smart contract.
