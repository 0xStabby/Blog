Bears in disbelief, bitcoin pumps from 18,000 to 100,000 in 15 minutes!

When I first checked my phone in the morning I was greeted with this message from Coinbase:

“We’re sorry, something may have gone wrong.”

I did not quite know how to react.

“Something may have gone wrong”?

I was sure that the message would be fixed by lunchtime.

As the day wore on I felt the pressure of a hundred questions. But as I had not a single answer, I chose to keep my thoughts to myself.

This may not have been the best way for me to handle it, but I have come to realise in recent times that no one is actually sure what is going on.

It is not just Coinbase. It is something that has happened quite a few times for me in the past few months.

On August 1st I tweeted about some of my concerns over my bitcoin holdings:

“I bought 100 of my bitcoin on Bitstamp on August 1st. I have not seen them since then. Is this normal?”

I received a reply from a user called “bitcoinstew”, who said –

“I don’t know what happens with your coins when you have a margin call and want to close positions.”

That was the closest I got to a response, and I was left wondering what exactly a “margin call” was.

It is no shock that a cryptocurrency like bitcoin should have a certain level of volatility, but in recent times the price of bitcoin has been rising by leaps and bounds.

A quick browse of the forums shows that it is something that is worrying many.

One user posted –

“I’ve been on a bit of a spending spree for the last month and a half or so and the margin positions seem to just sit there, as soon as I try to sell the bitcoin I get a margin call and it’s back in my favour and I can’t close them or they just stay open.”

The price of bitcoin was already way up and one user wrote –

“I have been closing my positions with margin calls, I was down to 18k and was down almost 20k in a matter of a few days. I am currently at 17k and down almost 30%.”

Another user had this to say about bitcoin –

”I just went to margin trade today but I didn’t have enough bitcoins to cover. It tells me that I am at my minimum amount, which is quite a bit less than I had before. Is this a good thing or what?”

There are many others that have voiced similar concerns but what all of these users have in common is that they have no idea what is going on to a large degree, they do not know why it is happening and they are not even sure when it will stop happening.

This can be tough to take, but I find that the best thing you can do is to keep your thoughts to yourself.

If I had been able to ask “bitcoinstew”, if the situation would have been “normal” perhaps it would have been less stressful for me, but for now I have to just accept it and learn to live with it.

I have to do the same with others as well. I am sure there are many who are wondering what is going on, and if anyone can help them out, they will be grateful.

The bottom line is that you must have patience though because the answer is not always there.

It was not the first time that I had seen the bear market in bitcoin – it was the first time that I had lost money on my bitcoin holdings.

On March 20th I bought 10 of my bitcoin on Bitstamp with a limit of 10 BTC.

One of the problems with bitcoin though was that the price of bitcoin had been rising rapidly since November 2017.

But I had not really noticed that rise because I was not paying much attention to the price in general. I had been spending a lot of time reading about cryptocurrencies and I had been making a list of things that I would buy once I had a bit more money.

I had heard a lot about the “bitcoin bubble,” but I just did not believe it would happen.

It was not until I had lost a few of my holdings that I started to think about the “bubble.”

I had initially thought that the price of bitcoin would continue to rise, and that I had been smart to buy early on.

But as the days
