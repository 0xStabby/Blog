## Why you should be writing tests first
Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs that are stored on a blockchain. They are designed to execute automatically when certain conditions are met, and they have the potential to revolutionize industries such as finance, real estate, and supply chain management. However, smart contracts can also be vulnerable to attacks, and if they are not properly secured, they can result in significant financial losses.

One way to ensure that smart contracts are secure is to use test-driven development (TDD). TDD is a development process that involves writing tests before writing the code. The idea behind TDD is that if you write the tests first, you can ensure that the code you write will pass those tests, which means that the code will be correct and functional.

Here are some reasons why TDD is important for writing secure smart contracts:

### TDD helps to catch bugs early
* One of the biggest benefits of TDD is that it helps to catch bugs early in the development process. By writing tests first, you can identify potential issues before they become more significant problems. This is especially important when it comes to smart contracts, where bugs can result in significant financial losses.

### TDD ensures that the code is correct and functional
* Another benefit of TDD is that it ensures that the code is correct and functional. By writing tests first, you can ensure that the code does what it is supposed to do. This is important when it comes to smart contracts, where even small errors can have significant consequences.

### TDD helps to ensure that the code is maintainable
* TDD also helps to ensure that the code is maintainable. By writing tests first, you can ensure that the code is modular and easy to update. This is important when it comes to smart contracts, where updates may be necessary to address security vulnerabilities or to add new functionality.

### TDD helps to ensure that the code is secure
* Finally, TDD helps to ensure that the code is secure. By writing tests that simulate attacks and other security threats, you can identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers. This is critical when it comes to smart contracts, where security is paramount.

In conclusion, test-driven development is a critical process for writing secure smart contracts. By writing tests first, you can catch bugs early, ensure that the code is correct and functional, make the code maintainable, and ensure that the code is secure. If you are developing smart contracts, be sure to incorporate TDD into your development process to ensure that your smart contracts are as secure as possible.
