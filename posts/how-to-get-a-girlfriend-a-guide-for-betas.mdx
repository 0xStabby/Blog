How to get a girlfriend, a guide for betas

![first post image](/images/how-to-get-a-girlfriend-a-guide-for-betas.png)

I'm a male, just turned 21 years old, recently went through a phase where I wanted to date a girl. I was in a relationship for awhile, actually. But after that, well, I just stopped. I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong, and I didn't know what to do, so I just sat around and watched TV. But I always wanted a girlfriend and I finally got up the courage to start dating a girl.

First of all, it can be intimidating meeting a girl in real life. People get really shy and kind of weird around each other, especially the girl. But, first impressions are just that, first impressions. And second, don't take it personally; some people just don't like you.

So, what I found is that it is very easy if you get a girl interested in you to pick her up. There's a few ways to go about picking up a girl, but the two main ways are:

1) Through a friend2) By yourself

The two main ways to get a girl to go to with you are:

1) Through a friend- Basically, I used the word "friend" like a lot because this will get a girl to go to with you. I know that if I'm talking to a girl, she's going to walk away. Unless it's a friend of hers. And I'm pretty sure that she isn't going to go home with a random friend of hers. And even if she did, she'll tell her friend that she met you. So, if you're talking to a girl and she walks off, that's your cue to go talk to her friends. You'll have to get her friends to introduce you to her. However, this is basically the same as getting a girl to go home with you, so it's not really worth it.

2) By yourself- This is pretty much what most people do. You don't go up to a girl and say, "Hey, I'm so hot, will you go to the park with me?" You go up to a girl and ask her if she wants to make out with you.

1) Getting a girlfriend can be very hard, especially if you're a girl who was in a relationship

2) You are only twenty years old, so no girlfriend is really that hard to get.

For those of us who are on our last chance before the real world sucks, we should take advantage of it.

I think that the first step is to get over the first impression by thinking, "I do not care what people think of me. I do not care if girls do not like me. I am not going to ask my friends for help. I can do this by myself." You have to force yourself not to care about whether people like you. Otherwise, you will not try to be popular. You will not try to get girls to go home with you. You will not put yourself out there. You will not do anything.
