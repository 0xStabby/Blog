## ChatGPT helped me make a ChatGPT Vim plugin

Have you ever wished you could use GPT-3's language generation capabilities
directly from your favorite text editor? Well, now you can! I'm excited to
announce the release of the [chatgpt-vim plugin](https://github.com/0xStabby.com/chatgpt-vim).

This plugin allows you to access the [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) API (a variant of GPT-3) directly
from Vim, allowing you to generate text snippets, complete code blocks, and
more. It's a great tool for writers, developers, and anyone looking to save time
and increase productivity.

But the story of how this plugin came to be is just as interesting as the plugin
itself. You see, I used ChatGPT to help me write the documentation and code for
the plugin itself. That's right â€“ ChatGPT helped me build a ChatGPT Vim plugin.

I started by asking ChatGPT to write the basic structure and documentation for
the plugin. From there, I was able to use its suggestions and output to guide
the development process. Along with some trial and error. 
It was a powerful way to use the tool, and it allowed me to move much 
more quickly than I would have been able to on my own.

Overall, the ChatGPT Vim plugin is a great example of the potential for
AI-powered tools to augment and enhance our work. I hope you find it as useful
as I do!


### Installation

To install the ChatGPT Vim plugin, follow these steps:

 1. Download the plugin files from the [chatgpt-vim](https://github.com/0xStabby/chatgpt-vim).
 2. Copy the files to your ~/.vim directory.
 3. Add the following line to your ~/.vimrc file: source ~/.vim/chatgpt.vim
 4. Restart Vim and you're ready to go!


### Usage

To use the [chatgpt-vim](https://github.com/0xStabby/chatgpt-vim) plugin, simply type `gpt` in normal mode followed by your prompt. 
For example, to generate a code block, you might type:

`gpt` > `Generate a Python function to reverse a string`

The plugin will:
1. Send your prompt to the ChatGPT API
2. Display the result to you
3. Ask if it should insert the generated text into your document at the current cursor.

I hope you enjoy using the [chatgpt-vim plugin](https://github.com/0xStabby.com/chatgpt-vim)! Let me know if you have any feedback or questions.
