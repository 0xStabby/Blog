BREAKING: Bitcoin has lost it's peg, 1 Bitcoin does not equal 1 Bitcoin!

Bitcoin price could soon be heading to the $200 region if a technical analysis is to be believed.

In a move that should worry cryptocurrency purists, Bitcoin has already gone back to being an entirely speculative asset, with the price no longer tied to a specific exchange rate.

Bitcoin, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, has been on an unstoppable tear in the face of market turbulence.

In just over one month's time, the cryptocurrency has gained over $1,600 and has now hit a new all-time high of $8,330.

But the bubble is about to burst. In the past 24 hours, BTC's price has fallen around 6.5 percent overnight, taking it back down to levels of around $7,000.

A technical analysis suggests that BTC could see further losses of more than 10 percent.

Bitcoin price could soon be heading to the $200 region if a technical analysis is to be believed.

In a move that should worry cryptocurrency purists, Bitcoin has already gone back to being an entirely speculative asset, with the price no longer tied to a specific exchange rate.

There are some fundamental reasons for the price decline, such as the recent slump in volumes on the Bitcoin Cash chain, which has reduced the supply of Bitcoin on the market.

Also adding to the pressure is the recent Bitcoin Cash hard fork — which resulted in the Bitcoin Cash chain gaining some market share.

The rest of the crash is all about technical factors.

As one cryptocurrency investor puts it:

"The price of Bitcoin is likely being held up by a technical support level of roughly $6,600, which was formed in March as a result of the large volume of sell volume on the market.

"This support level has since been tested, and its breakdown will likely result in a downward price trend followed by a likely decline of more than 10 percent at the time of writing."

The charts

Bitcoin went through a phase of huge price swings from roughly late 2017 to early 2018.

The cryptocurrency was trading around $4,000 for most of that time, and eventually broke through to the $10,000 region.

Since then, the cryptocurrency has remained fairly stable, which has attracted in a flood of new money looking to make a profit.

However, the price started to fall sharply in recent weeks, and dropped to below $6,000 recently.

One of the reasons behind the decline is the recent slump in volumes on the Bitcoin Cash chain, which has reduced the supply of Bitcoin on the market.

The BCH chain is now the third-largest cryptocurrency with a market size of $1.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

The most popular chain, Bitcoin, has a market size of $89 billion.

BTC is currently trading around $7,000, down from highs last week of around $8,000.

One cryptocurrency trader recently said that he expected BTC to test the $6,000 region.

His prediction came in the wake of a massive sell-off on Tuesday.

However, the recent sell-off only added to the pressure on the cryptocurrency.

The technical picture

The charts show that BTC experienced a big sell-off on Tuesday, with price falling to levels of around $6,700 in the Asia afternoon trading session.

Following that, BTC quickly bounced back to
