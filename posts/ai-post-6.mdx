Is Bitcoin a ponzi?

How Bitcoin was a Ponzi, Now it is a Pyramid Scheme

“One of the biggest factors in the growth of Bitcoin is that it’s the only way for people to exchange currencies” – Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin

The Bitcoin economy has exploded in less than a year. There are many people who are new to Bitcoin and they see it as a fantastic opportunity to make a lot of money.

The problem is, with so many new comers, the whole market is very volatile and it can be very profitable for just a couple of people. The problem is, many newcomers are just after a quick return.

And I think that’s exactly what the founders of Bitcoin and other “cryptocurrencies”, like Ethereum, are after. They want to create a new system where the big players (and themselves) can be the ones who are the winner. Just like with the old ponzi scams.

Before I go into the details of the cryptocurrency sector and its similarities to the old ponzi scams, let me state that Bitcoin is not a scam or a ponzi.

It’s more like a pyramid scheme, where the bigger players are the only ones who are the winner.

Here’s why:

Bitcoin is not real money

I’m going to make a bold claim here. Bitcoin is NOT real money.

It is a digital asset, which is based on something called the “blockchain”. But it’s not real, fiat money. Why?

Because:

* It is only as good as the other computers processing the transactions.

* It’s not backed by anywhere, not even the U.S. Fed. It has no value in itself.

* It can’t be taxed

* You can’t spend it anywhere

* It’s not printed by any government

* It’s not backed by any government

You can make as many as you want out of Bitcoin. But you still can’t take it anywhere or use it as real money.

Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme

Let’s try comparing a pyramid scheme to Bitcoin.

A pyramid scheme is a way to make money off of someone else. It’s a scam that preys on people’s greed.

Here are some of its characteristics:

* It’s a pyramid scheme.

* The people at the bottom are the ones who generate the revenue.

* The “investors” at the top make money off of this revenue.

The problem with Bitcoin is similar to the problem with a pyramid scheme.

* Everyone has to buy the tokens to be able to generate revenue.

* These tokens are used to make money, not real money.

* The tokens have no value or can’t be used elsewhere.

* It’s a pyramid scheme that can’t be backed, taxed, or regulated.

Now let’s look at the similarities between Bitcoin and ponzi schemes:

* Like a ponzi scheme, the people at the bottom are the only ones in the pyramid scheme who are making money.

* Like a ponzi scheme, the people at the top are making money off of the people at the bottom.

* Like a ponzi scheme, the only way to participate is by buying tokens.

* Like a ponzi scheme, the tokens are the currency and the only way to generate revenue.

* Like a ponzi scheme, the tokens have no value and cannot be used elsewhere.

Like with a ponzi scheme, it’s a pyramid scheme that needs a very large number of people to make the people at the bottom in the pyramid scheme wealthy.

* Like a ponzi scheme, the people at the top can make a lot of money.

And like with a ponzi scheme, it’s a pyramid scheme that can’t be regulated.

* Like a ponzi scheme, it’s very hard to regulate.

Like with a ponzi scheme, it’s a pyramid scheme where the people at the top are the only ones who win.

* Like a pyramid scheme, the people at the bottom lose.

What it’s NOT a pyramid scheme

Now, let’s see what it’s NOT a pyramid scheme.

* Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.

* It’s a currency that is not
