This is the best shitcoin you will want to know about!!

![first post image](/images/first-post-content.png)

How to buy

1. For those in the US and Canada, go to bitfinex.com

Buy bitcoin cash with USD and trade it

2. Then to get BCH, go to bch-official.com

They have both options with BTC or USD.

How to spend

3. Open a Trezor Wallet

4. Then you can send coins from your bch wallet to your trezor wallet by using the TREZOR app.

Where to spend

5. BCH is currently being sold at $900/1, so for now you have to wait until they raise the price or buy with BTC

When to buy

6. They said the price would be $1,000 per 1 at the start of November and it has moved up to almost $1,200

7. The price could go up to $2,000 in the next few months

How to store

8. They currently recommend hardware wallets

9. Be sure to check out the official Trezor website for more info. They have a lot of cool stuff.

Final verdict

If you’re wanting to buy BCH, this is a great start. The price is very high right now and it’s not likely to stay this high for too long. I think the price will be more stable around $1,000 or even $1,400/1

There has been some talk of them lowering the price to $900, but I think the market would be so huge that it wouldn’t happen.

I also think that we’ll see a lot more use cases and new applications built on this blockchain (similar to Ethereum).

If you’re looking to buy, you should buy a lot of BCH now. I’d wait until it drops to $900 before buying.

It’s going to be a wild ride. I’ll be keeping an eye on this coin.
