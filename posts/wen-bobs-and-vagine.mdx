Wen Bobs and Vagine

Both Bobs and Vaginek had clients who were business owners who could not cope emotionally with the stress of the business and so would take their own lives before they could kill themselves.

“I would never judge anyone for doing it,” Vaginek says. “I think it happens, particularly in the entrepreneurial space.”

Both of these entrepreneurs came from very different places. Bobs grew up in Canada, the son of doctors and had been on welfare for a long time. Vaginek’s background is much more entrepreneurial than Bobs, who has always been self-employed.

“Vaginek is more a small business kind of guy,” Bobs says. “He started his own marketing company. He was always interested in getting into software, and got an MBA. He worked in marketing.”

Bobs says that Vaginek started out selling himself off.

“He worked for five years and said he could make more money on his own. So he started his own company, and he just got really, really good at that.”

Vaginek’s first company was called Vaginek Marketing. “It was a software company that worked with retailers. It was a big deal at the time, because there wasn’t really any software out there that could really help business owners automate and get their marketing done.”

Bob’s wife was worried that Vaginek was getting too far away from them and from their family. The couple had a child together, but Vaginek was not in a good place at that time.

“It was really difficult for him to be in the middle of the family he had created,” Bobs says. “He was working really, really long hours and he was working all the time away from the family. That was a really difficult time for us.”

When Bobs was in his mid-40s, he started looking for a business to pursue.

“I had to make a decision,” Bobs says. “I had a lot of money in savings. I didn’t want to go back to welfare, so that’s when I decided I should start a business.”

Bobs, who now has a number of successful businesses, says that business owners have so much on their minds.

“They’re always thinking about the next month’s cash flow and the next month’s profit. They’re always thinking of new things they can try. That’s a tough thing to juggle, but a lot of people have to do it.”

“Bobs is really good at balancing his emotions,” says Vaginek. “He keeps it real.”

Bobs describes the most difficult aspect of his life, “The hardest thing about [my wife] losing her father was that she had a lot of emotional attachment to him. When you lose someone like that, it’s kind of a hard thing to absorb.”

“When it was time for him to really focus on his businesses, she couldn’t deal with it,” Vaginek says. “She kept losing her mind. When he had to leave, she just got so crazy.”

Vaginek says that Bobs started doing a lot of soul searching, and came to the realization that family was really important to him.

“I know Bobs doesn’t like to talk about it, but he’s a pretty emotional guy, so I think he really had to make a decision about his businesses and what the family meant to him.”

“He really needed to be a dad,” Vaginek says, “a real one, a real dad. He became a dad.”

Bobs’ business partners all had families. “I saw how hard it was [for Bobs] to be there for them,” Vaginek says. “Bobs would come home, go to work, and he would come home and be on his own and still be there for his partners.”

Vaginek’s wife struggled with his focus on his work. Vaginek says, “She was really upset. [My wife] would be so upset with me. And she was really upset when I would be with him late
