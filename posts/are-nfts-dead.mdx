Are NFTs dead?

![first post image](/images/first-post-content.png)

NFTs have been around a long time – as you probably know – and they’ve shown a lot of promise in the past, but have recently fallen victim to a bit of a ‘hype’ death. Despite this, there are still many interesting and potentially disruptive NFTs being created each week through projects like The Next Web’s weekly NFT roundup.

One of the reasons why NFTs have proven so popular is their ability to create a form of ownership in digital art that’s both fun and personal.

In short, they’re a whole new way of distributing and collecting digital art. That being said, most NFTs are a bit more ‘off the wall’ than most digital art, which I find to be a very good thing. However, that very sense of uniqueness can sometimes attract the wrong people – people who aren’t going to get the NFT, just to flip it for a bit of cash. These people, I think, represent a tiny minority of the NFT market.

The other problem that comes with NFTs, and some of the projects I’ve covered in this post, is that they are really expensive. That is, the NFT is only as good as the original art it represents, and the fees that are currently being charged for creating NFTs could be considered obscene.

However, there is a middle ground between the NFT craze that we’ve seen, and the current pricing of NFTs.

I’ve noticed that there’s been recently a lot of talk about the ‘death’ of NFTs. This has been a big disappointment to me as I think it’s one of the most exciting new ways that people are thinking about their digital art.

The biggest issue with NFTs is price and the amount of money that it costs to create them. To try and create an NFT that is ‘on the level’ of what these projects are usually selling for, you need to spend around $1000 to $2000. In addition, you also need to create a product that’s going to be unique. Not only that, but you need to be able to sell that product effectively, and retain your rights to it.

The fact is, this isn’t possible for most people. For many of us, it’s just not worth the trouble. Sure, you could spend $100 on a t-shirt, and get a lot of fun out of that, but it’s not the same as owning a piece of art you hand crafted. That is, it’s not something you can hang on the wall or have as a piece of furniture. It’s just a t-shirt.

To me, that’s the real reason why NFTs haven’t taken off. It’s not that they aren’t a good idea, it’s just that they’re just out of reach for most people.

How about the NFT market then? What about the people who are making them, and the people who are buying them? Do they know what they’re doing?

Let’s look at what’s happening in the NFT market.

The most common reason for creating a NFT is to build a brand and sell some merchandise. It has to be said that this isn’t the only reason for creating an NFT, but it’s the most common reason.

It’s been interesting to see the rise of projects that allow people to create their own unique NFTs. Projects like the NFT Maker are allowing people to create their own digital art, and in many cases sell it to other people. For the first time, people can create something that’s not just a t-shirt or a mug, but something that’s unique. Something that represents them.

Of course, this isn’t just a nice concept. It’s a big deal. Not only that, but it’s one that opens up a whole new way of collecting digital art.

I spoke to Jens Hilgers on Twitter about this a while ago, and he had this to say…

“NFTs are the biggest step forward for collecting since the first collectors’ market was established…”

This statement is one of the best summations of what NFTs have done – and can do.

These are the things that NFTs do differently compared to other ways of collecting digital art:

Ownership

Ownership is the biggest differentiator.
