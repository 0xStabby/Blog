Ethereum Hacked!

![first post image](/images/first-post-content.png)

Ethereum has been under a lot of fire in recent weeks. At the time of writing, it’s the 13th largest crypto in the world with a market cap of over 6.4B. It’s currently ranked as the 6th largest crypto by market cap.

That makes it by far the 2nd largest crypto project (behind BTC) with a market cap over 6x that of ETH. It’s a strong claim to fame.

It boasts a lot of developers and big names behind it. It’s held successful ICOs and been very public about it’s intentions.

Why is that it’s being criticized?

It’s been attacked for using the controversial EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that was designed by “The Ethereum Foundation”.

The EVM is the most widely used standard for smart contract development in the Ethereum network.

Ethereum relies heavily on the security of the underlying network to ensure that the distributed applications that are built on it are secure.

The Ethereum network is extremely secure thanks to the mining of the Ether that backs up the network and the Proof of Work method that helps make sure the miners spend their time on the network, instead of on exploiting the network like they could in a centralized system.

It’s also been attacked by the developers for providing too great a power to the miners, as it gives them too much sway over where funds go and what can be built and created on the Ethereum network. They want to change the way that miners are paid and they are worried the current system will cause Ethereum to fail.

But that’s not all!

Another attack the network has been involved in is an ICO with a very shady and shady person behind it. It’s the ICO that’s given us the infamous DAO disaster.

The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization. It was a fund that was designed to let its users vote on projects that would get funded. It was designed to take votes from people all over the world and give them the power to decide which projects get funded.

It was a very ambitious project. It looked like it could get very big. But it came with a lot of problems.

It was funded by the Ethereum network.

It had a lot of people working on it and the whole team (including some of the biggest names in Ethereum) put their money into it.

But it also had a single programmer with a shady reputation and a lot of money behind him who had a lot of influence over what could be done with the funds. Unfortunately, he made a lot of bad decisions with his control over the funds. It resulted in a bad experience for most of the people who invested in it.

One of the main criticisms of the DAO was that it had no way to recover the money lost. If you got invested and lost money on Ethereum, you couldn’t withdraw it.

The team behind the DAO released a software update that basically made it the DAO again. It took the decentralized decision making power away from the members of the DAO and gave it to a single person. While the team argued that they were not the ones who made the decision to release the system as an update and were not in control of it, it was clearly an attempt to take away what the DAO represented. The money had already been invested, they didn’t have any money to give back, but they did have the ability to take away the power that the network holders gave them.

The DAO is currently on a legal path to get its money back, as it is trying to prove the DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization and not a centralized one.

The team behind the DAO made it very clear that this was all just a single person’s project. They were not the ones controlling the funds, they would give any money they had back as soon as possible.

But the community is suspicious that there was a lot more to it.

Ethereum’s core developers and other big names are not happy with the way that the DAO was handled, while the community has been very public in their criticism of the project.

There have been criticisms of the way the Ethereum Foundation took part in the projects’ financing, the way they handled the updates to the network, the lack of transparency, and other things.

Ethereum recently started moving towards a better system.

The DAO is not the first attempt at this. In fact, the DAO is based off of a similar concept to one of the original ideas that was put forward for Ethereum.

But the DAO is by far the biggest and
