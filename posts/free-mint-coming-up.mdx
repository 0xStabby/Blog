Free Mint coming up!

![first post image](/images/first-post-content.png)

It's been an amazing year so far and we have lots more to come! Our very own Chris Molanphy has been making some epic music and art videos for us. We hope you enjoy a selection of them - including the awesome "Christmas Special" we will be releasing today:

The Mint Family is proud to announce its first Holiday release! "Christmas in the U.P." is the first official Mint Family release since its reformation in 2015.

"Christmas in the U.P." is the holiday album that a special group of us have been working on since July. The first full-length holiday of the year is packed with the usual Mint Family traditions, but unlike any of our previous Christmas releases. The album is a heartfelt tribute to the many people who have helped build the Mint Family over the years. We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it :)

This will not be an album that you can buy in a store. Once the tracks are complete, the album will be available as a digital download. We wanted to share this project with our fans and supporters first and it was important to us that we released this on a platform which we trust to provide fans with the best possible experiences. We hope you enjoy the album and we appreciate your support.

With Christmas right around the corner, we’re excited to announce “The Mint Family’s Christmas in the U.P.” Holiday Album will be available for download here:

The Mint Family is an award-winning, all-acoustic, progressive-folk band from Western New York whose music has been described as “dreamy and haunting, with deep roots and a musical foundation that is both unique and accessible” (The Wall Street Journal, December 2011).

Hailed by Rolling Stone and The New York Times, The Mint Family’s signature style has taken it far and wide the U.S., Germany, Austria, Sweden and Mexico. In the past three years alone, The Mint Family has been featured in more than 35 publications and media outlets including Billboard, NPR, Yahoo Music, People, and the Milwaukee Sentinel. Read up on how the band is growing in the Music Press, here:

The Mint Family will be releasing its new full-length holiday release "Christmas in the U.P.” December 1st.

“This is our first full-length holiday release since we reformed in 2015 and I’m really proud of how it turned out. We’ve had such an amazing year and are excited to share these songs with our fans in the upcoming month!” said founding member and guitarist Chris Molanphy.

In celebration of the release, The Mint Family will be releasing a Christmas-themed music video for “The Christmas Song,” the original recording of the song. The video will be a collaboration between members Chris, Dan, and Jon and will be released on Vimeo.

Mint Family is made up of Chris Molanphy (guitar), Jon Rieser (keyboards), Dan Pugsley (bass), and Jon Bisset (drums). They also feature several friends and family members, including Jon’s wife Aimee and Chris’s wife and bandmate Mariah. Jon and Aimee have four sons, two of whom are in Mint Family.

“We’ve been together for so long, and we’ve learned so much from each other,” says Mariah, who has been in Mint Family since the beginning.

“In addition to being great musicians, Jon and Aimee are wonderful, supportive parents. I feel really lucky, and it’s always been a real joy being a part of the Mint Family.”

“The Mint Family has become my family, my very special family, but there is another family that I’m proud to be a part of: the families of the victims and survivors of the Las Vegas shooting,” said Jon Rieser. “It’s been a humbling, heart-warming, and extremely difficult time for everyone, and I’m so glad to have this moment to do something in the name of love.”

“Christmas in the U.P.” is a celebration of the Mint Family’s past and where it’s headed in the future, and is a reflection on the bond between family, friends, and the music we love.

The Mint Family will be performing its holiday release at the Highline Ballroom, New York City on Friday, December 1st, with two shows at 8 PM and 10 PM, and $20-$35 tickets will go on sale
