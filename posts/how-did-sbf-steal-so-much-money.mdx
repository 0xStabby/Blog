How did Sam Bankman-Fried steal so much money?

Bankman-Fried made the headlines when he admitted to investigators that he had stolen $5.8 million from his employer from 2000 to 2003. The case resulted in an investigation by the FBI and California Attorney General into his dealings in real estate.

"I'm not a criminal," Bankman-Fried said in March 2010.

He told authorities that he had stolen the money while working for a homebuilder called D.E.E.H. Construction. He said he was so intent on stealing the money that he began forging checks and paying his own bills with them.

His scam was uncovered when he left the job in 2003 and his bosses noticed a dramatic difference in his financial situation, he told authorities.

Bankman-Fried was arrested in November 2010 after being arrested on four additional counts of forgery.

He pleaded guilty to a count of mail fraud over $1 million and a count of fraud. He was sentenced in June to 14 years in prison.

The San Diego Union-Tribune in 2008 profiled Bankman-Fried. At the time, he was homeless and living in an SUV.

The paper quoted the former soldier who was a decorated combat veteran. Bankman-Fried had been in the Army for six years before his discharge in 1993 for "a psychiatric condition." Later, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Bankman-Fried told the paper at the time: "I'm not a criminal. I'm not a bad person. I'm not a hero. I'm not a martyr. I'm just a young man who was born into this life and made a few bad decisions."

He told the paper that he had recently received an honorable discharge from the Army. He said he wanted a second chance.

"Every morning I wake up and I'm reminded of how far I've come," he said.

His friends and family said they were shocked by the fraud.

"I would say of all the scams that have occurred, this is the biggest scam," said Lenny Bankman, Sam's brother.

Bankman-Fried's attorney did not return a call for comment.

The question still lingers. How did Bankman-Fried steal so much money?

It's a question the San Diego Union-Tribune's investigative reporter, Dan Richard, is trying to answer.

Richard has spent several years investigating Sam Bankman-Fried's case and he said he thinks he has found an answer. It's one that doesn't involve Bankman-Fried.

"It wasn't Sam who did the crime of stealing millions of dollars," Richard said. "The people who did it are still running the country."

His investigation has revealed that Bankman-Fried was an unwitting pawn in a much greater fraud.

Richard said he thinks the scheme began in 1993 when one of the world's largest money launderers, a man known as "the Godfather," wanted to move some of his dirty money into the U.S. He hired Bankman-Fried to carry out a complicated scheme.

"Bankman-Fried, with the help of others, stole $20 million from the Godfather in order to launder the money," Richard said.

Bankman-Fried spent five years doing the work. But he never discovered he was laundering money for the mob. He never got his first commission.

"There is a saying in the real estate business that if you don't ask, you don't get," Richard said. "Bankman-Fried didn't ask any questions, because he wanted money. But he never got any."

The stolen money ended up in the hands of several different people, including some from a San Diego drug cartel. After that cash came into play, the scheme grew bigger.

"Eventually Sam Bankman-Fried got a piece of this huge puzzle," Richard said. "He only got a piece, but he was one of the first to break into the safe."

As the scam grew, so did the money. In 2003, Bankman-Fried was hired by D.E.E.H. Construction to handle the company's finances.

"Everything was going pretty good," Bankman-Fried told authorities. But he said they noticed a dramatic difference in the company's finances.

They discovered someone was writing checks to themselves and other people outside the company.

"We put it down to one of the guys taking a break
