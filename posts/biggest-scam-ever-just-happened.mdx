Biggest Scam Ever just happened!

I’ve always been an advocate of saving money. I’m also an advocate of trying to save as much as I can. But I’m finding as I age, I’ve had to change how I do things, or at least how I feel about the things I’ve been doing.

I found out last year that I’m allergic to dairy, and my doctor was going to need to do a blood draw to test. Then I found out that the price for that test was $100.

So, I went to my regular doctor and asked that it be covered by my insurance. She agreed, but the insurance company told me that it was not covered – even though my doctor had told me they would cover it.

I called the insurance company, and talked to a different agent who told me that the policy would cover the test and that my insurance would pay. I was told to keep it as a $100 credit for services.

I got my blood drawn, and when it was determined that I was allergic to dairy, my doctor asked me if I wanted to pay for another test to confirm the allergy. I told her no, but that I wanted to pay for the testing.

However, it still wasn’t covered. I explained that I had already paid out of pocket for the first test. I was told it wasn’t.

So, I called the insurance to explain the situation. The agent I spoke to was kind enough to send me a letter that explained that my insurance did not cover the second test, and that I would have to pay for it.

I’m sure that part was a shock, but it wasn’t the shock that I wanted to share with you. The shock was something that happened at a local grocery store a couple of weeks later.

This is where my story gets good.

I was at the grocery store picking up some items and I noticed the cashier was wearing a shirt with the logo “The Biggest Scam Ever just happened! And here’s how to avoid it!”

That’s right, it was a shirt that explained to people how they could avoid scammers.

The shirt made it seem like the scammers were in the habit of taking people’s money at the grocery store.

The idea behind the shirt was that scammers would be coming up to people at the grocery store and trying to take their money.

I bought that shirt for $5, because it was a funny thing, but I didn’t think much about it.

I knew it was just a shirt, so I figured, it was probably okay to laugh at.

As I was walking out of the store, I started getting messages left on my phone. I’m not sure how, but somehow the scammers knew that I had the text message on my phone, and they also knew that I was just out of the store.

They were contacting me with messages on my phone and telling me to go to a website: www.thebiggestscamever.com/2f. They sent me a link to a website that had pictures and information about the scam.

Now, I don’t know if I’m the most gullible, or if people who are supposed to know better fall for scams like this time and again, but I was shocked to see this happen.

I didn’t realize until this happened, how easy it is to fall for a scam, or to be taken advantage of. But I can’t say that I’m surprised. I’ve been in this line of work for going on 15 years now. I’ve seen people and companies try to scam people and companies for a long time.

What was shocking was that I went back into the store and bought another shirt, just in case more people were being scammed. I’ve seen the Biggest Scam Ever shirt everywhere, so I thought it might be a good idea to protect people who may still be getting email messages from scammers now that the shirt was in circulation.

The next day, I was at the grocery store and saw the same cashier. I asked her if she’d bought one of the “Biggest Scam Ever” shirts, and she said no. She said she had tried to get one, but there were none to be had. I asked her how she knew I was going to buy one. She said she just knew.

So, what’
