Dogecoin the best coin in the world!

It is easy to say dogecoin and get a negative response because "it is a joke coin". Well I think that's a little harsh on those who want to get involved, but it is true that doge is a low priority because of it's reputation. It is a cute coin and does have a fair amount of money behind it. If you are a casual investor and haven't looked into it, I recommend you do! Not only can you take part in the fun, but you will also make a lot of money if you invest wisely.

The dogecoin project was funded primarily by Billy Markus & Jackson Palmer and they have done quite well with the project so far. They have their own twitter page and a lot of the dogecoin community has grown from dogecoin fan pages that have popped up on facebook. They also have a wiki page and a community wiki page as well. There is also a dogecoin subreddit!

In a recent interview, Jackson Palmer gave some interesting information regarding dogecoin. He said that dogecoin is not a joke and they do have the technical skills to develop the coin. He also said they are trying to do some things beyond just the community and they have some plans to launch other coins with dogecoin in the future. He said that if they are able to find the right people to lead the other projects, they will be successful.

I asked some of the dogecoin team members if they would be interested in writing a blog for this site, and they responded saying that they were interested. I am putting together a team and will be posting a call for writers to write for my site.

The main point I want to get across is that dogecoin is growing in popularity and has great potential to grow and become one of the biggest coins in the world. It has a very friendly community behind it. I think it could be the next big thing and it is my goal to bring it to the masses.

I hope you can take this information and look into dogecoin and what it has to offer! I also think it is a great opportunity for you to make money!

If you are interested in being a writer for my site, please send me an email to rwaltz@dogecoin.info and tell me a little bit about yourself. I am currently looking at writers who have good experiences writing blogs for blogsites, writing in other languages, or have some experience in writing for websites. I think it would be best if the articles were written in a style that a reader could understand. I would also love to bring in people with a variety of views, experience, and knowledge.

Thank you for reading!

My Dogecoin Wallets

I did some research on the dogecoin wallets and I found a few that are available for you to test.

The first wallet I found is dogecoin wallet. I have used this wallet before and I do recommend it for the beginner who don't know too much about doing things on the dogecoin site. I did a test on how dogecoin worked with the wallet, and I received my test coins. I was able to withdraw from the dogecoin wallet in less than two hours, and I felt it worked very well. They have a mobile app as well.

If you want to learn more about this wallet, check out this link: https://dogechain.info/

The second wallet I would recommend is the official dogecoin wallet that comes with the dogecoin site. I have not used this wallet so I cannot comment on it, but I did try it out. If you click on the wallet, you will be taken to the dogecoin wallet info page.

There is a link on the side of the wallets where you can download the dogecoin wallet on your computer.

These are the steps to install the wallet on your computer:

The wallet will be installed to "C:\Users[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Dogecoin\wallet.dat.exe"

The folder where your wallet is installed is in your computer. C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Dogecoin

You can check on your wallet on dogecoincash.com to see if the amount of coins you are holding matches your balance.

I hope you found this information useful and I would
