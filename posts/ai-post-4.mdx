SBF Arrested in the Bahamas, to face extradition to the US

The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Tuesday that the Bahamas’ Supreme Court had temporarily halted the extradition hearing of businessman Shi Dakuan to face charges in the United States.

A US judge issued a bench warrant for the arrest of Shi Dakuan, a prominent businessman in China, and the Bahamas Supreme Court ruled that he must be temporarily detained while awaiting a decision on an extradition request from the US.

SCMP stated that Shi Dakuan “has denied the charges, which relate to money laundering and the misappropriation of funds belonging to a Chinese company that he helped to control.”

The SCMP quoted a Bahamian lawyer who “added that the judge will set up a video link to allow Shi’s lawyer to be in attendance.”

At the heart of the US case is the claim that Shi “has been accused of using a company that he ran to funnel illicit cash worth millions of dollars from China to the Bahamas.” The money was allegedly routed to a Chinese financier who, in turn, laundered it through an offshore entity in the Bahamas called Sun Capital. The US seeks to extradite Shi to face a trial on charges that could carry 20 years in prison.

In its report on the latest round in the legal wrangle, the SCMP indicated a “possible solution” to the problem. “Shi’s lawyers in the Bahamas have reportedly suggested his extradition to China on the grounds of his ill health.”

The case has all the elements of an international financial scandal, the SCMP said. Shi “has been a very wealthy and influential businessman in China.” Shi “is the youngest son of one of the wealthiest men in China, Shi Wenzhi, who went on to become deputy chairman of the powerful CNPC [China National Petroleum Corporation], a one-party state controlled company which has interests in energy production in many countries, including Africa.”

Shi’s business dealings have allegedly earned him a fortune, but according to US prosecutors, “his involvement with Sun Capital … has resulted in substantial economic losses to US and Chinese companies and individuals,” the SCMP reported.

Shi is also alleged to have been a source of funds for Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, or “Big Daddy Guo,” who has been accused by the Chinese authorities of undermining the Chinese Communist regime.

Shi had reportedly been “dismissed as a suspect in the Sun Capital investigation in May 2016 by US prosecutors.” “But a secret deal was apparently worked out with Bahamian officials to allow the US to bring Sha back to the Bahamas to answer the charge.”

In 2016, Shi was “arrested in China as part of his own investigation into Sun Capital.” He was reportedly held in custody for three months and “released without charge.”

Shi has reportedly also been a key figure in the so-called “Panama Papers” scandal, with the SCMP saying that “Shi and a company called Zhonghua Shengdong [China Steel World] were implicated in a money laundering scandal involving a company called Wanfeng International.”

Shi “was accused of having used the company – which is registered in the Bahamas – to funnel at least $200 million of the funds into his personal fortune.”

This is not the first time that Shi has been in the spotlight. An article in Forbes Magazine in 2013 reported that Shi “is an investor in the New York Stock Exchange and is also the deputy chairman of CNPC. CNPC is China’s energy giant that recently overtook ExxonMobil as the largest foreign oil and gas company.”

Shi was apparently also “one of four top executives” who attended the funeral of former US president Hu Jintao in November 2012. At the event Shi “was publicly recognized as the vice chairman of CNPC. He was also chairman of the company’s international committee.”

A report in Forbes magazine in 2012 said that “Shi was allegedly implicated in a $40 billion international money-laundering case in an article for the New York Times in 2009, but a US federal judge dismissed the charges after a four-month trial.”

Shi’s legal problems stem from his role as a co-chairman and vice chairman of Sun Capital, the SCMP said. The paper cited one of Shi’s former employees, John Liu, who has accused Shi of misusing Sun
