The rise and fall of Binance

![first post image](/images/The-rise-and-fall-of-Binance.png)

The company, founded in March 2017, is also well known for its innovative approach to cryptocurrencies. Since its beginnings, the exchange has introduced decentralized exchanges and even a native token (the exchange coin) that now serves as the base for all trading pairs.

But it wasn’t always like this. Binance almost certainly wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the rise and fall of another, much smaller exchange.

Brief history of Binance

Cryptocurrency trading has been a crowded space for years. But as recently as April 2017, some of the top exchanges in the world (including Binance) were operating in relative obscurity.

The exchange had not yet launched (it had an official website and was accepting registrations, but no one was actually using it yet). It had not yet opened a fiat gateway and it was not available in a language other than Chinese.

The exchange was being operated by a small team of young developers and a team at the crypto wallet provider, Trust Wallet.

It launched in July 2017, and was operated by a team at OKEX. The exchange took off in a viral way, and before long had become the most popular crypto exchange in China. Before the Chinese crypto crackdown in September 2017, Binance’s website was generating 10,000 visits per hour. By January 2018, Binance was generating more than 200,000 visits per hour.

After the crackdown on crypto, OKEx (the company behind Binance) was taken offline by the Chinese government and Binance’s founders moved the exchange to Japan and eventually to Malta.

Following the change of location, Binance’s market share in China began to drop. It remained the most popular exchange in Japan and Taiwan, though.

The team behind Binance, which was still operating under OKEx, took on the project of launching its own exchange and became the Binance team. The exchange launched in March 2018, and since then, it has been the most popular crypto exchange in the world. It claims market share of more than 70 percent in most areas, and over 40 percent in China.

Binance is by far the most profitable exchange in the crypto space. The company has raised more than $1 billion in capital as of April 2019. The exchange generates more than $1 billion of annual revenue and is the most profitable cryptocurrency exchange in the world.

The company was founded by Zhao Changpeng, better known as CZ, who also founded OKEX.

The exchange was built on the concept of open source, and the exchange token, Binance Coin (BNB), has been designed to be a utility token that is used to pay fees and fees for the services provided by the exchange. Users can exchange BNB for other tokens and cryptocurrency directly through the Binance exchange.

Binance Coin is currently the fourth largest crypto by market capitalization (currently at $14.6 billion).

Binance token

The exchange’s new decentralized exchange project, called Binance DEX, came into effect in May 2019. It has a native token that powers the exchange. The project is being developed by a team called Binance Labs and has been in development since March 2018.

The Binance exchange has been very proactive in its marketing of the Binance DEX.

On March 13, Chen published an announcement on the official Binance blog, explaining the launch of the open-source Binance Chain, an Ethereum-based blockchain with a permission-less smart contract platform and sidechains.

He revealed that the launch of the Binance Coin (BNB) was also on the horizon, as part of the Binance DEX — the upcoming decentralized exchange project.

The idea is that Binance Coin will serve as the fuel for the Binance DEX exchange, and will be used for network transaction fees and other expenses.

The announcement went on to say that the Binance DEX would be the first decentralized exchange to support multiple tokens.

Airdrop

On April 20th, the exchange announced an airdrop for Binance Token holders. Binance would give 3% of the total supply of BNB to every BNB holder. That amounted to around 2.38 billion BNB, or around $37 million at the time.

The airdrop would take place between May 5 and May 15. Binance was also offering a trading competition to incentivize the airdrop.

The exchange would award the winner a prize of 100,000 BNB in addition to an airdropped
