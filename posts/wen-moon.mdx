Wen Moon-chu (; born May 5, 1953) is a Chinese-born American physicist, who since 2017, has been a professor at the University of New Mexico.

Personal life 
Wen married his first wife Chen-Yu, who was from Taiwan. Their daughter, Wu Fei-yun, was born in 1972.

Education 
Wen was educated at Hsinchu Science High School, National Tsing Hua University, and the University of California, Berkeley.

Academic career 

Wen was a research associate at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 1977 to 1985, and was a professor at the University of Oregon from 1985 to 2017.

Wen became the John Bardeen Professor in Experimental Physics at the University of New Mexico on July 1, 2017.

Wen gave the Nobel Lecture at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in December 2017.

In 2018, Wen was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS).

Wen is a member of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and has served as the chair of the International Association for Condensed Matter Physics.

Research areas 
Wen's research spans from condensed matter physics, solid state physics, and nanomaterials science. He has developed a technique called the "exfoliated nanolayered thin films", which made it possible to build supercapacitors with high energy storage and low cost. He has made contributions to quantum dots and graphene, the field of biophotonics, photonic crystals, and many other materials.

Wen is also known for his works using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a technique which was invented in 1969 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center by John J. Wooton, Paul H. Bucksbaum, and Paul C. Weisz.

Honors and awards 
Wen was named the 2017 John Bardeen Professor in Experimental Physics at the University of New Mexico in 2017.  He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2018.

In 2018, he was given the J. Maurice Schutz Award. 

Wen is also a recipient of the prestigious Wolf Prize in Physics in 2016.

Wen won the Robert H. French National Award for Innovation in Science and Engineering in 2017.

Wen has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society.
